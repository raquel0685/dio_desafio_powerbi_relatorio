# *Creating a classy sales report with Power BI*
### Challenge from the Santander Bootcamp 2023 - Data Science with Python

A two-page report was created using the **financials** sample furnished by  *Power BI*.  
The dataset has registries of 2013 and 2014 reports of sales and profit from a company according to the products sold, segments worked, and countries they sell to.  
With the instructor, we created the sales report visuals and markers for a more interactive experience. The profit report was created alone, applying the concepts and techniques acquired.  
Afterwards, the reports were published on *Power BI Web*.
